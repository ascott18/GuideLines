# GuideLines

GuideLines allows you to create movable guides on the screen to aid in positioning UI elements, as opposed to most other UI positioning addons that only create lines that are rigidly spaced and unmovable. GuideLines also displays the exact coordinates of your cursor for precise positioning.

Instructions:
* Type /guidelines or /guides to show the rulers and begin creating guides.
* To create a guide, click and drag from one of the rulers on the sides of your screen.
* To delete a guide, drag it back to the ruler that it originated from.
* Right click a ruler to move it to the other side of the screen.
* Guides are saved between sessions, so don't worry about losing them when you reload your UI as you set up your addons.

Compatible with AddonLoader, so it won't load until you need to use it.
